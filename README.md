# ChessELO
.NET library to help calculate chess ELO scores.  Includes a demo application.

ChessELO version 1.0.0.0

Released 2008-10-07 by Ryan Whitworth (me@ryanwhitworth.com)<br>
Inspiration for this program came from the perl module Chess::Elo<br>
written by Terrence Brannon.  His module is copyright 2003, and<br>
is under the artistic license and GPL v1 (or any later version)<br>
license schemes.  As such, my program is following the artistic<br>
license.  A copy of the artistic license is included in this archive.<br>
Source code for Terrence's Chess::Elo package can be found on<br>
any CPAN mirror site (http://search.cpan.org/src/TBONE/) and is not<br>
included in this package, as no actual running program code was<br>
directly copied.

This program is released under a freeware artistic license.

This program requires .NET 3.5 or higher.
