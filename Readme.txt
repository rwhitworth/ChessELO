ChessELO version 1.0.0.0

Released 2008-10-07 by Ryan Whitworth (me@ryanwhitworth.com)
Inspiration for this program came from the perl module Chess::Elo
written by Terrence Brannon.  His module is copyright 2003, and 
is under the artistic license and GPL v1 (or any later version)
license schemes.  As such, my program is following the artistic
license.  A copy of the artistic license is included in this archive.
Source code for Terrence's Chess::Elo package can be found on 
any CPAN mirror site (http://search.cpan.org/src/TBONE/) and is not
included in this package, as no actual running program code was
directly copied.

This program is released under a freeware artistic license.

This program requires .NET 3.5 or higher.
